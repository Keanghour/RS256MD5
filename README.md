# RS256MD5
This project integrates RSA encryption with both MD5 and SHA-256 hashing for enhanced data security. RSA handles encryption/decryption, while MD5 and SHA-256 generate and verify hashes of the data. This dual-hashing ensures strong data integrity and protection against tampering during transmission.
